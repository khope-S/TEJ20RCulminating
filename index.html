    <h3>Introduction to Me</h3>
    <p>Hello there, I am Sanchit Khope, a Mississauga-based Grade 10 student studying at Port Credit Secondary School. I am passionate about exploring new concepts and turning them into physical projects that I can share with the world. Whether it's through coding traffic sequences, designing chess pieces, or presenting my thoughts in general, I enjoy the process of bringing my ideas to life. Beyond academics, I constantly seek inspiration through creative sources. Here is a quote that truly inspires me and keeps me motivated every day.</p>
